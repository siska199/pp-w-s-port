          Reengineered the GOA application, transitioning from an outdated .NET 4 UI to a modern
          React-based interface using Vite, resulting in a 62% increase in speed compared to the
          previous application. This transition also led to improved user satisfaction, evidenced by
          positive feedback from users regarding the enhanced performance and usability of the new
          interface.{' '}
